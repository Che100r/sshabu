  # Changelog generation implementation to use.
  #
  # Valid options are:
  # - `git`: uses `git log`;
  # - `github`: uses the compare GitHub API, appending the author login to the changelog.
  # - `gitlab`: uses the compare GitLab API, appending the author name and email to the changelog.
  # - `github-native`: uses the GitHub release notes generation API, disables the groups feature.
  #
  # Default: 'git'
  use: git

  # Sorts the changelog by the commit's messages.
  # Could either be asc, desc or empty
  sort: asc

  # Max commit hash length to use in the changelog.
  #
  # 0: use whatever the changelog implementation gives you
  # -1: remove the commit hash from the changelog
  # any other number: max length.

  # Since: v1.11.2
  abbrev: -1

  # Paths to filter the commits for.
  # Only works when `use: git`, otherwise ignored.

  # Default: monorepo.dir value, or empty if no monorepo
  # Since: v1.12 (pro)
  # This feature is only available in GoReleaser Pro.

  # Group commits messages by given regex and title.
  # Order value defines the order of the groups.

  #
  # Matches are performed against the first line of the commit message only,
  # prefixed with the commit SHA1, usually in the form of
  # `<abbrev-commit>[:] <title-commit>`.
  # Groups are disabled when using github-native, as it already groups things by itself.
  # Regex use RE2 syntax as defined here: https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax.
